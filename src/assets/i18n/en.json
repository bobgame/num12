Twelve is also a highly composite number, the next one being twenty-four. Twelve is a sublime number, a number that has a perfect number of divisors, and the sum of its divisors is also a perfect number. Since there is a subset of 12's proper divisors that add up to 12 (all of them but with 4 excluded), 12 is a semiperfect number. The number 12 is also a superfactorial, being the product of 3, 2, 1, and 1. Lastly, 12 is a Harshad number since it is divisible by the sum of its base 10 digits."
